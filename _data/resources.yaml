  description: Pangolin was developed to implement the dynamic nomenclature of SARS-CoV-2 lineages, known as the Pango nomenclature. It allows a user to assign a SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence the most likely lineage (Pango lineage) to SARS-CoV-2 query sequences.<br><br>Pangolin assigns lineages to query sequences as described in Rambaut et al 2020.

  description: Llama pulls out local trees from a large tree (e.g. the global SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny) from a set of queries. Will also optionally add in new sequences to the local trees on the fly. <br><br>Llama is available as a command line tool. It is open source software available under the GNU General Public License v3.0.
