<h1>Constellations</h1>

A constellation is a collection of mutations which are functionally meaningful, but which may arise independently a number of times. <br><br>

Here we include files that define:<br><br>

<ul>
<li>lineages of concern - for these lineages, the defining mutations have been extracted so that individual sequences can be classified deterministically</li>
<li>genomically interesting regions e.g. RBD sites which interact with ACE2</li>
</ul>
